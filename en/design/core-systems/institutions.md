# Core Institutions

> Charter Ref: Principle 3 - "Politics is primarily institutional, not heroic"
> Charter Ref: Principle 12 - "Before adding content, define core institutions"

Institutions are the structural constraints through which all player actions flow. They shape what is possible, not just what is optimal.

---

## Design Criteria for Institutions

Each institution must:
- Constrain certain player actions
- Enable certain player actions
- Be modifiable through policy (but with costs)
- Create checks and balances with other institutions
- Never be fully controllable by a single player

---

## Proposed Core Institutions

### 1. Legislature
**Function:** Passes policies, controls budget allocation

**Constraints it creates:**
- Policies require legislative approval (majority/supermajority)
- Budget must be allocated through legislative process

**Player interaction:**
- Build coalitions
- Trade votes
- Block opposition policies

**Modifiable aspects:**
- Voting thresholds
- Committee structures
- Term lengths

---

### 2. Judiciary
**Function:** Constitutional review, rule enforcement

**Constraints it creates:**
- Can strike down policies as "unconstitutional"
- Delays implementation of contested policies
- Protects certain rights from policy changes

**Player interaction:**
- Judicial appointments (if applicable)
- Policy wording to avoid review
- Constitutional amendments (high cost)

**Modifiable aspects:**
- Judicial independence level
- Review scope
- Appointment process

---

### 3. Executive
**Function:** Policy implementation, crisis response

**Constraints it creates:**
- Implementation capacity limits
- Emergency powers have legitimacy costs
- Cannot legislate alone

**Player interaction:**
- Prioritize implementation order
- Emergency declarations
- Veto power (if applicable)

**Modifiable aspects:**
- Executive scope
- Emergency power limits
- Term structures

---

### 4. Markets
**Function:** Economic activity, resource generation

**Constraints it creates:**
- Budget depends on economic activity
- Policy costs affected by market conditions
- Cannot fully control outcomes

**Player interaction:**
- Regulatory policy
- Fiscal/monetary policy
- Trade policy

**Modifiable aspects:**
- Regulation level
- Market openness
- State involvement

---

### 5. Public Opinion
**Function:** Legitimacy source, electoral pressure

**Constraints it creates:**
- Unpopular policies cost legitimacy
- Electoral cycles create time pressure
- Cannot be directly controlled

**Player interaction:**
- Policy timing
- Communication/propaganda
- Crisis narrative

**Modifiable aspects:**
- Media landscape
- Information access
- Polling visibility

---

### 6. Civil Society
**Function:** Organized interests, watchdog function

**Constraints it creates:**
- Mobilization against policies
- Transparency pressure
- Alternative power centers

**Player interaction:**
- Coalition building
- Co-optation vs. confrontation
- Funding/regulation

**Modifiable aspects:**

## Open Questions

- [ ] How do players interact with institutions? (Control seats? Influence meters?)
- [ ] Should institutional "health" be a tracked metric?
- [ ] How do institutions differ across scenario/country setups?
- [ ] Should "Media" be separate from Public Opinion?
