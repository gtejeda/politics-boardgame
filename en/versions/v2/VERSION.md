## What's Different from v1

| Aspect | v1 | v2 |
|--------|----|----|
| Format | Resource tracking board | Path-based race (like Life) |
| Turn structure | 6 phases per round | Roll → Discuss → Vote → Move |
| Complexity | 90-120 min, high cognitive load | 45-60 min target, accessible |
| Core mechanic | Delayed effects + institutions | Positive-sum negotiation |
| Movement | N/A | Dice + ideology alignment bonuses |
| Lose condition | Multiple collapse thresholds | Stability or Budget collapse |
| Win condition | Legacy scoring after 10 rounds | First to End of Government |

## Design Principles

Maintains charter principles while simplifying:

- **Ideological neutrality** → All ideologies valid paths to victory
- **Mandatory tradeoffs** → Every card option helps some, hurts others
- **Mechanics teach** → Negotiation dynamics mirror real politics
- **Failure is instructive** → Collapse includes historical parallels

Simplified for accessibility:

- 6 institutions → Collective voting
- Complex feedback loops → Direct card effects
- Delayed timeline → Position on path
