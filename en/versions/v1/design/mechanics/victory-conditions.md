# Victory Conditions

## Design Philosophy

Victory conditions must:
1. Reflect different legitimate political philosophies
2. Be achievable through different strategic paths
3. Not declare any outcome as morally superior
4. Show that even "victory" comes with unresolved tensions

---

## Victory Condition Options

### Option A: Multi-Dimensional Scoring
**How it works:** Final score combines multiple metrics with player-chosen weightings

Players declare (or secretly bid on) which dimensions matter to them:
- Economic prosperity
- Social cohesion
- Institutional strength
- Liberty preservation
- Global influence
- Long-term sustainability

**Pros:**
- Multiple paths built into scoring
- Reflects real political diversity
- Reduces "solved game" problem

**Cons:**
- Complex calculation
- May feel abstract

---

### Option B: Objective Achievement
**How it works:** First player to achieve a specific end state wins

Possible objectives (player chooses or is assigned one):
- Maintain all resources above threshold for X rounds
- Achieve dominant position in Y metric
- Control key institutions
- Complete a reform agenda

**Pros:**
- Clear goals
- Dramatic endings

**Cons:**
- May funnel strategies
- Risk of "obvious" best objective

---

### Option C: Survival + Legacy
**How it works:** Game ends after fixed rounds; survival + achievement determines winner

- Must avoid collapse conditions (automatic loss)
- Among survivors, score based on achievements
- Post-game "legacy" evaluation shows long-term implications

**Pros:**
- Emphasizes sustainability
- Dramatic loss conditions
- Educational post-game

**Cons:**
- May feel punitive
- Player elimination issues

---

### Option D: Competitive-Cooperative Hybrid
**How it works:** Players can win individually OR collectively

- System threats require cooperation to survive
- But only one player wins if system survives
- Everyone loses if system collapses

**Pros:**
- Models real political dynamics
- Creates interesting dilemmas
- Prevents purely destructive play

**Cons:**
- Complex to balance
- May frustrate some players

---

## Proposed Approach: Survival + Multidimensional Legacy

Combining elements:

1. **Survival Threshold:** All players must keep core metrics (Budget, Legitimacy, Stability) above collapse levels
2. **Victory Scoring:** Among survivors, score based on multiple dimensions
3. **Player Choice:** Before game, players choose/draft their victory focus
4. **Unresolved Tensions:** Final scoring shows what was sacrificed for victory

---

## Loss Conditions (Failure States)

> Charter Ref: Principle 11 - "Failure Is Instructive"

Each loss condition should be clearly traceable to choices:

| Loss Condition | Triggered By | Root Causes |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Budget Collapse | Budget ≤ 0 for 2+ rounds | Overspending, economic neglect |
| Legitimacy Crisis | Legitimacy ≤ 0 | Broken promises, corruption, tyranny |
| Systemic Breakdown | Stability ≤ 0 | Rapid change, inequality, neglected institutions |
| Authoritarian Lock | Liberty ≤ 0 + trigger | Security overreach, power concentration |
| Revolutionary Overthrow | Combination threshold | Inequality + low legitimacy + low liberty |

---

## Post-Game Debrief

To fulfill "failure is instructive" principle:

1. **Decision Timeline:** Review major choice points
2. **Consequence Chains:** Show which choices led to outcomes
3. **Alternative Paths:** What could have been done differently
4. **Tensions Revealed:** Show what winning path sacrificed

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should victory be competitive (one winner) or comparative (ranking)?
- [ ] How do we handle player elimination mid-game?
- [ ] Should different player counts have different victory conditions?
- [ ] Is there a "mutual destruction" ending if all players fail?
