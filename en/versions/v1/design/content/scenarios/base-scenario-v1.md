# Base Scenario: The Republic v1.0

> A fictional democratic nation facing the challenges of modern governance.
> Designed as the default first-play experience.

---

## Setting: The Republic of Valdoria

Valdoria is a mid-sized democratic nation with a mixed economy. After decades of relative stability, the country faces mounting pressures: economic transformation, social change, and institutional strain. No single faction controls the government - coalition governance is the norm.

**This is intentionally fictional** to avoid real-world political baggage. Players can project their own context or treat it as pure abstraction.

## Starting Conditions

### National Resources

| Resource | Starting Value | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Budget** | 8 | Moderate fiscal position |
| **Legitimacy** | 10 | Functional but not beloved government |
| **Stability** | 10 | No major unrest |
| **Growth** | 5 | Modest economic expansion |
| **Liberty** | 10 | Standard democratic freedoms |
| **Inequality** | 3 | Some inequality, not critical |

### Institution Strengths

| Institution | Starting Strength | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **Legislature** | 3 | Functional democracy (simple majority) |
| **Judiciary** | 3 | Moderate constitutional review |
| **Executive** | 3 | Competent implementation |
| **Markets** | 3 | Balanced stability/dynamism |
| **Public Opinion** | Approval 5 | Neutral public mood |
| **Civil Society** | 3 | Active but not dominant |

### Player Setup

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Starting Influence** | 5 per player |
| **Starting Hand** | 5 Policy cards |
| **Rounds** | 10 (adjustable: 8 for shorter, 12 for longer) |

---

## Faction Assignment

**Random assignment recommended** for first game. Shuffle faction cards and deal one to each player.

For experienced groups: Draft factions in reverse victory-point order from previous game.

### The Five Factions

| Faction | Theme | Starting Bonus |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| **Progressives** | Social reform, equality | +1 Legitimacy on Social policies |
| **Conservatives** | Tradition, stability | +1 Stability when blocking change |
| **Liberals** | Markets, liberty | +1 Growth on deregulation |
| **Nationalists** | Security, sovereignty | +1 Stability on Security policies |
| **Populists** | Anti-establishment | +1 Legitimacy opposing institutions |

[DISCUSS] For 3-player games: Remove Populists and Nationalists, leaving center-spread factions.

---

## Special Rules: The Republic

### Coalition Government
At game start, the two players with highest starting Influence (roll off if tied) form the **Governing Coalition**. They:
- Take turns being First Player (alternating)
- Gain +1 Influence when policies they jointly support pass
- Lose -1 Influence each if a Crisis event occurs

Coalition can be dissolved by mutual agreement or if either member vetoes the other's policy. New coalition forms next round (open negotiation).

### Valdorian Constitution
Certain policies trigger Judiciary review:
- Any policy reducing Liberty
- Any policy modifying Institution Strengths
- Any policy labeled "Constitutional" in text

Judiciary review: Roll 1d6. If result ≤ Judiciary Strength, policy is blocked unless Legislature achieves supermajority (4+ votes regardless of player count).

### Economic Baseline
Valdoria has a mixed economy. At the start of each Consequences phase:
- Markets generate: Roll 1d6. On 1-2: Growth -1. On 3-4: No change. On 5-6: Growth +1.
- This represents baseline economic activity independent of policy.

---

## Victory Conditions: The Republic

### Collective Loss
If any of these occur, all players lose:
- Budget ≤ 0 for 2 consecutive rounds
- Legitimacy ≤ 2
- Stability ≤ 2
- Liberty ≤ 3 AND a Security policy passes (Authoritarian Lock)
- Inequality ≥ 10 AND Stability ≤ 5 (Revolution)

### Game End
The game ends after Round 10 (or when a Crisis event specifically ends the game).

### Individual Victory
Among survivors, score Legacy points:

**Choose 2 Legacy Priorities (secretly, before game starts):**

| Legacy | Scoring Formula |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Prosperity** | +1 per Growth above 5, +1 per Budget above 10 |
| **Equality** | +3 if Inequality ≤3, +1 if 4-5, -1 if 6-7, -3 if 8+ |
| **Freedom** | +1 per Liberty above 10 |
| **Order** | +1 per Stability above 10 |
| **Institutions** | +1 per Institution at Strength 4+, -1 per Institution at Strength ≤1 |
| **Influence** | +1 per 3 Influence remaining |

**Bonus Points:**
- +3 Most policies sponsored and passed
- +2 Correctly predicted final Public Opinion (guess before Round 8)
- +2 Never broke a deal (honor bonus)
- +1 Per round as part of Governing Coalition

**Highest total wins.** Tiebreaker: Highest remaining Influence.

## Starting Event Deck

For The Republic, use these event categories:

| Category | Cards | Severity Mix |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Economic | 10 | 4 Minor, 4 Moderate, 2 Major |
| Social | 8 | 3 Minor, 3 Moderate, 2 Major |
| Political | 8 | 3 Minor, 3 Moderate, 2 Major |
| International | 6 | 2 Minor, 3 Moderate, 1 Major |
| Natural | 4 | 2 Minor, 1 Moderate, 1 Major |
| **Crisis Cards** | 2 | Shuffle into bottom half of deck |

**Total: 38 cards** (36 regular + 2 Crisis)

Remove before play:
- War Declaration (save for "Federation" scenario)
- Constitutional Crisis (save for "Transition" scenario)

---

## Starting Policy Deck

Distribute policy cards as follows:

**Deck composition:**
- 12 Economic (balanced left/center/right)
- 12 Social (lean slightly left)
- 12 Security (lean slightly right)
- 12 Institutional (balanced)
- 12 Foreign (balanced)

**Initial deal:**
1. Separate by category
2. Each player draws 1 from each category = 5 cards
3. Shuffle remaining into central deck

**During play:**
- Draw 2 per round from central deck
- Discard down to 5 at end of round

## Post-Game Discussion Guide

After playing, consider discussing:

1. **What policies worked/failed?** Why did certain approaches succeed?

2. **What tradeoffs felt hardest?** Which decisions had no good options?

3. **Did ideology matter?** Could you have played any faction the same way?

4. **What would you do differently?** How would knowing the outcome change your strategy?

5. **Real-world parallels?** (Optional) Did any game moments remind you of real political situations?

6. **System insights?** What did you learn about how political systems work?

---

## Variant: Compressed Game (60 minutes)

For shorter sessions:
- 6 rounds instead of 10
- Starting resources: Budget 6, others unchanged
- Remove 1/3 of event deck (proportionally)
- Crisis cards removed entirely
- Legacy scoring at half values (round up)

---

## Variant: Extended Campaign (3+ sessions)

For ongoing play:
- Play 10-round "terms"
- Between terms: Election event (special)
- Faction control may change
- Institution strengths carry over
- Cumulative Legacy scoring
- After 3 terms: Final winner
