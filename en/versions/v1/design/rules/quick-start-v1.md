# Quick Start Rules (1 Page)

## The Goal
Govern a nation together without letting it collapse. Among survivors, the player with the highest Legacy score wins.

---

## Setup (5 min)
1. Set resources to starting values: Budget 8, Legitimacy 10, Stability 10, Growth 5, Liberty 10
2. Each player: Take a Faction card, set Influence to 5, draw 5 Policy cards
3. Secretly choose 2 Legacy priorities (don't reveal until game end)
4. Highest Influence rolls form Governing Coalition; take First Player marker

---

## Each Round (6 Phases)

### 1. Events
Draw 1 Event per player. Resolve "Immediate" events now. Place "Pending" events on timeline.

### 2. Deliberation (5 min)
Discuss, negotiate, plan. Select 1 Policy from hand you might sponsor.

### 3. Policy Actions
Clockwise from First Player, each player may:
- **Sponsor** (pay 2 Influence): Put your Policy up for vote
- **Vote**: Everyone votes Yes (+1), No (-1), or Abstain (0). Spend Influence for extra votes.
- **Resolve**: More Yes than No = passes. Ties fail.

Max 3 policies pass per round.

### 4. Implementation
For each passed policy:
- Roll d6 vs Judiciary Strength if it affects Liberty (blocked if roll ≤ Strength)
- Roll d6 vs Executive Strength for implementation (full effect if roll ≤ Strength, half otherwise)
- Apply immediate effects; place delayed effects on timeline

### 5. Consequences
- Resolve delayed effects scheduled for this round
- Apply feedback loops (check resource thresholds)
- Roll for Markets: 1-2 = Growth -1, 3-4 = no change, 5-6 = Growth +1
- Adjust Public Opinion based on resource changes

### 6. Refresh
Draw 2 Policy cards (discard to 5). Pass First Player left. Check for collapse.

---

## You All Lose If...
- Budget ≤ 0 for 2 rounds
- Legitimacy ≤ 2
- Stability ≤ 2
- Liberty ≤ 3 + Security policy (Authoritarian Lock)
- Inequality ≥ 10 + Stability ≤ 5 (Revolution)

---

## Scoring (After Round 10)
Reveal Legacy priorities. Score based on final resource values:
- **Prosperity**: +1 per Growth/Budget above thresholds
- **Equality**: +3 if Inequality ≤3, penalties if higher
- **Freedom/Order**: +1 per Liberty/Stability above 10
- **Institutions**: +1 per strong institution
- **Influence**: +1 per 3 Influence remaining

Bonuses: +3 most policies passed, +2 kept all deals, +2 predicted final Approval

**Highest total wins!**

## Key Reminders
- Every policy has a tradeoff - there are no perfect choices
- Delayed effects trigger later - plan ahead
- You need each other to survive, but only one can win
- Institutions constrain you - respect or erode them at your peril
