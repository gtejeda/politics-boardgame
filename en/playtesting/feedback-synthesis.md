# Playtest Feedback Synthesis

Aggregated learnings from all playtest sessions to inform future design iterations.

---

## Sessions Summary

| Session | Version | Players | Focus | Key Outcome |
|---------|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| [Game 01](sessions/game-01/) | v1 | 4 | Basic mechanics | Validated core loop, identified complexity issues |
| [Game 02](sessions/game-02/) | v1 | 5 | Negotiation & deals | Exposed onboarding gaps, cognitive load problems |

## Critical Issues (Must Fix for v2)

### 1. Onboarding Confusion

**Problem:** Players don't understand setup before they understand the game.

| Issue | Root Cause | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Ideology selection unclear | No guidance on random vs. preference | Players don't know what factions mean |
| Influence bonus unexplained | Only appears via events | Players confused about starting state |
| Personality types | Sample game flavor, not rules | Players think it's a mechanic |
| Legacy priority selection | "Choose 2" without procedure | No visible pool, scoring unclear |
| Starting hands random | No faction alignment | Disconnect between identity and options |

**Recommendation:** Create a scripted setup phase that teaches as it proceeds.

### 2. Cognitive Load

**Problem:** Making good decisions requires political expertise the game doesn't provide.

| Issue | Root Cause | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Event evaluation | Effects require understanding system | Players can't assess tradeoffs |
| Coalition formation | Why fight for events unclear | Strategic goals obscured |
| Policy selection | Too many interacting variables | Analysis paralysis |

**Recommendation:** Make tradeoffs immediately visible on cards. Provide decision heuristics.

### 3. Procedural Gaps

**Problem:** Rules don't specify key procedures explicitly.

| Issue | Clarification Needed |
|-------|---------------------|
| Who draws events? | First Player draws all, or each player draws one? |
| Card secrecy | When are hands hidden vs. revealed? |
| Deal binding | v1 says "no binding commitments" but unclear |
| Coalition benefits | Only explained when the event triggers |

**Recommendation:** Create explicit step-by-step procedures for each phase.

## Moderate Issues (Should Address)

### Complexity Budget

| Element | Count in v1 | Observation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Institutions | 6 | Too many to track; consider 3 |
| Resources | 5 + Influence | Manageable but interconnected |
| Phases | 6 per round | Consequences phase rarely understood |
| Delayed effects | Timeline board | Creates cognitive overhead |

### Strategic Clarity

- Players unclear on *why* to form coalitions beyond vote count
- Individual victory conditions (legacy) compete with survival
- Feedback loops are invisible until triggered

---

## What Worked Well

1. **Core tension** - Semi-cooperative creates meaningful negotiation
2. **Deal-making** - Players enjoyed the social dynamics
3. **Faction identity** - Players connected with their roles
4. **Tradeoffs** - Policy cards felt meaningful
5. **Event variety** - Created interesting situations

---

## Design Recommendations for v2

### Priority 1: Reduce to Essentials
- 3 institutions max (Legislature, Executive, one constraint)
- Fewer resources or combine related ones
- Remove or simplify delayed effects

### Priority 2: Teach Through Play
- Scripted first round as tutorial
- Player aid cards with faction-specific guidance
- Visible decision frameworks on components

### Priority 3: Clarify Procedures
- Numbered setup steps
- Explicit card visibility rules
- Clear phase boundaries with reminders

### Priority 4: Consider Radical Simplification
- What if there were no factions, just positions?
- What if the board taught the system?
- What if one game mechanic carried most of the weight?
