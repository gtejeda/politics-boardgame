## ACTING NOTES

**Your Arc:**
1. **Coalition deal-maker** (Round 1)
2. **Exposed and extorted** (Round 2) - Diego squeezes you
3. **Budget saver** (Round 3)
4. **Power struggles** (Round 4-5) - Fighting for Growth
5. **Exhausted** (Round 6) - Out of Influence

**Key Dramatic Moments:**

**The Extortion (Round 2):**
> "That's extortion!"

*Diego knows your priority. He has leverage. You have to pay.*

**The Block (Round 4):**
When Anna blocks your Privatization:
> "Anna! You blocked it!"

*Genuine frustration - you needed that Budget!*

**The Exhaustion (Round 6):**
> "I have 0 Influence. I can't sponsor anything."

*You spent everything fighting for Growth. Worth it for your priority, but costly.*

**Key Relationships:**
- **Anna:** Coalition ally, then tension over Inequality vs Growth
- **Bruno:** Coalition ally, reliable
- **Diego:** Transactional - he extorted you, but you need each other
- **Elena:** Ideological opponent on economic policy

**Your Dilemma:**
Your TWO priorities conflict:
- **Prosperity** wants you to pass policies (spend Influence)
- **Influence** wants you to hoard power (save Influence)

The game forces you to choose. You chose Prosperity.

**Remember:**
- Growth is your lifeblood
- Every Inequality increase helps Growth-focused policies
- You're not evil for wanting economic growth
- Diego's extortion wasn't fair, but you survived

---

*Good luck, Liberal! The economy is in your hands.*
