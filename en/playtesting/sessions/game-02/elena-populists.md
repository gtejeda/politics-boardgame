## ROUND 1: THE OUTSIDER

### Events Phase

*Anna is forming a coalition. You want no part of it.*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Coalition governments are just elite power-sharing. Count me out. I'll be the opposition."

*You are NOT in the coalition. Good. You'll attack from outside.*

### Deliberation Phase

*When others discuss Economic policies:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "You're all just protecting your own interests. What about the people? I have Wealth Redistribution: Budget -1, Inequality -2, but Growth -1."

*When Clara rejects it:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "See? The elite coalition protects Growth over equality. Typical."

### Policy Actions Phase

**ON ALL COALITION POLICIES:**
- Vote NO (you're the opposition)
- Spend 1 Influence on Law and Order opposition

**SAY THIS (on Law and Order):**
> "Liberty erosion begins. The authoritarians show their true colors."

*When Anna votes Yes on it:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "You're already compromising your principles, Progressive."

---

## ROUND 2: THE SECRET DEAL

### Deliberation Phase

*Diego approaches you with a secret deal:*

**DIEGO SAYS:** "The coalition is weak. Anna almost defected. Help me destabilize them."

**SAY THIS:**
> "Why would I trust you? You're anti-establishment."

*DIEGO SAYS:* "Exactly. I want to tear down their cozy arrangement."

**SAY THIS:**
> "Name it."

*DIEGO SAYS:* "When I sponsor National Security Act, you vote Yes."

**SAY THIS (hesitant):**
> "That's Liberty -2. My voters would hate that."

*DIEGO SAYS:* "Do you want to break the coalition or not?"

**SAY THIS (reluctantly):**
> "...Deal. But only if you help me pass Wealth Redistribution afterward."

**SECRET DEAL #4 ESTABLISHED:**
- You support National Security Act (Diego's)
- Diego supports Wealth Redistribution (yours)

### Policy Actions Phase

**ON DIEGO'S INDUSTRIAL POLICY:**
- Vote NO (coalition policy, you're opposition)

**SPONSOR: Wealth Redistribution**
- Pay 2 Influence (now at 3)

**SAY THIS:**
> "Wealth Redistribution: Budget -1, Inequality -2, Growth -1"

*Watch the votes... Diego should vote YES...*

**DIEGO ABSTAINS!**

**SAY THIS (outraged):**
> "You promised!"

*DIEGO SAYS:* "I didn't vote against you. Technically keeping my word."

**SAY THIS (furious):**
> "That's a betrayal of spirit!"

*DIEGO SAYS:* "Welcome to politics."

**YOUR REACTION:**

**SAY THIS (to the table):**
> "Diego, you traitor! You abstained!"

**SAY THIS:**
> "The deal was SUPPORT, not abstain!"

*Call for a group ruling on whether Diego broke the deal*

**ARGUE:**
> "Support means YES vote, not sitting on the fence!"

*Bruno should rule in your favor*

**WHEN RULED IN YOUR FAVOR:**

**SAY THIS (to Diego):**
> "Gladly. I was going to betray you anyway."

*Policy fails. You're furious. But you have moral high ground.*

## ROUND 3: BITTER OPPOSITION

### Deliberation Phase

*Watch with satisfaction as the coalition tears itself apart*

**SAY THIS (amused):**
> "The coalition is cracking already. Beautiful."

*When Anna gets hit by assassination attempt:*

**SAY THIS (mocking):**
> "Funny how the Progressive gets targeted. Maybe it's karma for abandoning your coalition on my vote."

*When Bruno calls you out:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "What? Just making an observation."

*When Anna leaves the coalition:*

**SAY THIS (satisfied):**
> "The Conservative reveals his true priorities. Austerity over people."

### Policy Actions Phase

**ON ALL POLICIES:**
- Vote based on whether they help Equality (reduce Inequality)
- Continue opposing the establishment

---

## ROUND 4: NEW ALLIANCE

### Events Phase
*Unity Government Proposal*

*You need this - you're weak*

**SAY THIS (reluctantly):**
> "Fine. But this doesn't mean we're friends."

### Deliberation Phase

*Approach Bruno with a surprising deal:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Bruno, you're the wild card now. What do you want?"

*Offer a trade:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "I want Wealth Redistribution passed. It failed before."

*BRUNO SAYS:* "That hurts Growth. Clara and Diego will never support it."

**SAY THIS:**
> "What if you support it? Your Institutions priority doesn't care about Growth."

*BRUNO SAYS:* "True..."

**SAY THIS:**
> "Exactly. You support my social policy, I support your next institutional policy."

**DEAL #7 ESTABLISHED:**
- Bruno supports Wealth Redistribution
- You support Bruno's next Institutional policy

### Policy Actions Phase

**SPONSOR: Wealth Redistribution** (again)

*Bruno should vote YES this time!*
*Clara and Diego will spend heavily to block it*
*Policy fails AGAIN*

**DEAL #7 STATUS:** Bruno honored it (he voted Yes). You still owe him.

---

## ROUND 5: THE DEBT

### Events Phase
*Your INFLUENCE priority exposed!*

**SAY THIS (defensive):**
> "So? Power matters."

*Election is coming. Bruno is ahead.*

### Deliberation Phase

*Bruno will want you to honor Deal #7 for Constitutional Amendment*

*Consider trying to escape:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Bruno, what if we modify the deal?"

*Negotiate for Bruno to spend Influence, reducing his Election lead*

**DEAL #7 MODIFIED:**
- You support Constitutional Amendment
- Bruno spends at least 1 Influence on his own policy vote

### Policy Actions Phase

**ON BRUNO'S CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT:**
- Vote YES (you made the deal)

**SAY THIS (explaining to others):**
> "I'm keeping my modified deal. Yes."

**DEAL #7 FULLY HONORED** - You kept your word!

---

## ROUND 6: FINAL ROUND

## ACTING NOTES

**Your Arc:**
1. **Defiant outsider** (Round 1) - "Elite power-sharing"
2. **Betrayed** (Round 2) - The Diego moment
3. **Bitter critic** (Round 3) - Watching coalition burn
4. **Pragmatic dealer** (Round 4-5) - Deal with Bruno
5. **Dignified loser** (Round 6) - You kept your word

**THE KEY MOMENT - The Betrayal (Round 2):**

This is YOUR scene. Diego betrays you. Play the full range of emotions:

1. **Shock:** "You promised!"
2. **Fury:** "That's a betrayal of spirit!"
3. **Cold anger:** "Diego, you traitor! You abstained!"
4. **Final cut:** "The deal was SUPPORT, not abstain!"
5. **Satisfaction when vindicated:** "Gladly. I was going to betray you anyway."

That last line is dark humor - you're claiming you would have betrayed him, but actually you probably wouldn't have. You're just saving face.

**Key Relationships:**
- **Anna:** Fellow outsider, occasional ally on Equality
- **Bruno:** Unexpected ally via Deal #7, you respect his consistency
- **Clara:** Economic enemy, she blocks your Wealth Redistribution
- **Diego:** THE BETRAYER - this defines your game

**Your Philosophy:**
- The establishment is corrupt
- Elites protect each other
- The people deserve better
- But sometimes you need to work within the system (Deal #7)

**The Tragedy:**
You came in 5th place. But you:
- Kept your word (unlike Diego)
- Fought for Equality
- Never compromised your anti-establishment values

You lost the game but kept your integrity.

**The Irony:**
Diego broke his deal with you and it cost him the game.
Bruno honored his deal with you and WON.
Honesty won. Your philosophy was vindicated.

**Key Lines:**

On the coalition:
> "Coalition governments are just elite power-sharing. Count me out."

On Diego's betrayal:
> "That's a betrayal of spirit!"

To Diego afterward:
> "Gladly. I was going to betray you anyway."

On the coalition collapsing:
> "The coalition is cracking already. Beautiful."

**Remember:**
- You're not crazy, you're principled
- Your Wealth Redistribution keeps failing, but you keep trying
- The establishment always finds a way to stop you
- But at least you can say you never broke a deal

---

*Good luck, Populist! The people remember who fought for them.*
