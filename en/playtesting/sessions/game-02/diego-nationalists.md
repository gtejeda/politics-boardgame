## ROUND 1: OUTSIDE THE COALITION

### Events Phase

*Anna is forming a coalition. Test her limits!*

**SAY THIS:**
> "I'll join if you promise to support a Security policy for the border tensions."

*When Anna refuses:*

**SAY THIS (accepting):**
> "Then find someone else. But good luck passing anything without votes."

*You're NOT in the coalition. That's fine - you'll negotiate from outside.*

### Deliberation Phase

**SAY THIS (challenging Clara):**
> "What do I get if I vote Yes?"

*When Clara offers future Economic policy support:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Deal."

**DEAL #3 ESTABLISHED:**
- You support Free Trade (Round 1)
- Clara supports one of your Economic policies (future)

*Also negotiate with Bruno:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Bruno, if the coalition supports Industrial Policy next round, I'll vote for Law and Order."

**DEAL #2 ESTABLISHED:**
- You support Law and Order (Round 1)
- Coalition supports Industrial Policy (Round 2)

### Policy Actions Phase

**ON BOB'S LAW AND ORDER:**
- Vote YES (Deal #2)

**ON CAROL'S FREE TRADE:**

**SPONSOR: Industrial Policy** (but it gets TABLED - max 3 policies)

---

## ROUND 2: COLLECT ON DEALS + THE SECRET DEAL

### Deliberation Phase

**SAY THIS:**
> "Time for you to honor Deal #2. I want votes for Industrial Policy."

*Watch the coalition squirm when Anna resists*

### SECRET DEAL WITH ELENA

*Approach Elena privately during deliberation:*

**SAY THIS (whispered):**
> "The coalition is weak. Anna almost defected. Help me destabilize them and I'll support your Security policies."

*When Elena asks what you want:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "When I sponsor National Security Act, you vote Yes."

*Elena will resist (Liberty -2). Push:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Do you want to break the coalition or not?"

**SECRET DEAL #4 ESTABLISHED:**
- Elena supports National Security Act (yours)
- You support Wealth Redistribution (Elena's)

### Policy Actions Phase

**SPONSOR: Industrial Policy**
- Pay 2 Influence (now at 3)

**SAY THIS:**
> "Industrial Policy: Budget -2, Growth +1, Stability +1"

*Coalition should honor Deal #2. Policy passes.*

**ON ELENA'S WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION:**

**THE BIG MOMENT - YOUR BETRAYAL**

*You promised to SUPPORT Elena's policy. But it kills Growth (your Prosperity priority).*

**SAY THIS (quietly to Elena):**
> "I can't support this publicly. It kills Growth. I'm abstaining."

*Elena will be furious:*
> "You promised!"

**SAY THIS (coolly):**
> "I promised to support it. Abstain is not opposing. Technically keeping my word."

*When Elena calls it betrayal:*

**SAY THIS (iconic line):**
> "Welcome to politics."

- Vote ABSTAIN (not Yes, not No)

*Policy fails anyway. Elena is furious.*

**DEAL #4 RULING:**
*The group will vote on whether you broke the deal*

**ARGUE:**
> "Abstain is neutral. I didn't oppose her. The word was 'support' but I didn't work against her."

*You will probably lose this argument. Bruno will likely rule against you.*

**IF RULED BROKEN:**

**SAY THIS:**
> "Fine. But Elena, our arrangement for National Security Act is void then."

**YOU LOSE "NEVER BROKE A DEAL" BONUS** (-2 points at end)

---

## ROUND 3: PARIAH STATUS

### Deliberation Phase

*Elena hates you. Coalition doesn't trust you. Clara still owes you.*

**SAY THIS (to Clara):**
> "You still owe me policy support. Deal #3 is intact."

*When Clara proposes Deregulation:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "This counts as one of the two Economic policies you owe me, Clara."

*Renegotiate to extract more value*

### Policy Actions Phase

*Support Budget-recovering policies*
*Vote against anything that hurts Growth*

---

## ROUND 4: UNEXPECTED ALLIANCE

### Events Phase
*Unity Government Proposal*

**SAY THIS (to Anna and Elena):**
> "Anna, Elena - think about it. You both have low Influence. You need this more than anyone."

### Deliberation Phase

*Approach Clara for a Growth-protection alliance:*

**SAY THIS:**
> "Clara, our priorities align. We both need Growth. Let's coordinate."

### Policy Actions Phase

**ON ANNA'S WORKERS' RIGHTS ACT:**
- Vote YES (Growth -1 is manageable, builds goodwill)

**ON CLARA'S PRIVATIZATION:**
- Vote YES (protects Growth)

**When it fails:**

**SAY THIS (to Clara):**
> "Anna blocked us. She's the enemy now."

---

**SAY THIS (to Clara):**
> "We had to. We can't let Growth crash."

*Temporary alliance with Clara is working*

---

## ROUND 6: FINAL ROUND

### Events Phase

## ACTING NOTES

**Your Arc:**
1. **Outsider deal-maker** (Round 1) - Extracting value from all sides
2. **The betrayer** (Round 2) - "Welcome to politics"
3. **Pariah** (Round 3) - Trust destroyed
4. **Pragmatic ally** (Round 4-5) - Growth coalition with Clara
5. **Regret?** (Round 6) - Peace offering to Elena

**THE KEY MOMENT - The Betrayal (Round 2):**

This is the most important scene in the game. Play it with cold calculation:

1. When Elena's policy comes up, look conflicted
2. Say (quietly): "I can't support this publicly. It kills Growth. I'm abstaining."
3. When she protests: "I promised to support it. Abstain is not opposing."
4. Deliver the killer line with a shrug: **"Welcome to politics."**

This line should become legendary in your group.

**Key Relationships:**
- **Anna:** Ideological opponent, occasional transactional ally
- **Bruno:** Respects deals, works with you on Deal #2
- **Clara:** Economic ally, she owes you, you extract value
- **Elena:** YOU BETRAYED HER - this defines the game

**The Tragedy:**
You're smart. You're strategic. You played everyone.

But your betrayal of Elena costs you 2 points.
Bruno wins with 12 points.
You tie for 2nd with 11 points.

**If you had voted YES on Wealth Redistribution:** You'd have 13 points and WON.

The lesson: Sometimes honoring deals IS the best strategy.

**Remember:**
- You're not evil, you're pragmatic
- "Welcome to politics" is your signature line
- The abstain technicality seemed clever in the moment
- But clever isn't always smart

*Good luck, Nationalist! Politics is about consequences.*
