## ACTING NOTES

**Your Arc:**
1. **Coalition member** (Round 1-2) - Reliable, deal-making
2. **The "villain"** (Round 3) - Fiscal Responsibility breaks coalition
3. **Strategic operator** (Round 4-5) - New deals, positioning
4. **Victor** (Round 6) - You won through consistency

**Key Dramatic Moments:**

**The Deal Defense (Round 2):**
> "You were standing right there!"

*Deliver with genuine surprise - you thought Anna agreed*

**The "Cold" Decision (Round 3):**
> "The nation needs Budget stability. It's not personal."

*You're not being cruel - you genuinely believe this is necessary*

**The Patience Payoff (Round 5):**
When you're ahead for Election bonus, maintain composure. You earned this through consistent dealing.

**Key Relationships:**
- **Anna:** Ally who becomes accuser - you didn't betray her, you did what was necessary
- **Clara:** Coalition ally who remains reliable
- **Diego:** Transactional - honored Deal #2
- **Elena:** Unexpected ally via Deal #7

**Your Principles:**
- Institutions must be protected
- Fiscal responsibility is not optional
- Deals are sacred - you always honor yours

**The Irony:**
You're painted as the "bad guy" for Fiscal Responsibility, but:
- Anna broke the coalition, not you
- You honored every deal
- Your consistency WINS THE GAME

**Remember:**
You're not evil. You're pragmatic. When others accuse you of being cold, remember: you kept every promise. They didn't.

*Good luck, Conservative! Your discipline wins.*
