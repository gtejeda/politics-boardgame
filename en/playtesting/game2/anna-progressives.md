## ACTING NOTES

**Your Arc:**
1. **Optimistic coalition leader** (Round 1)
2. **Uncomfortable with coalition deals** (Round 2)
3. **Breaking point** (Round 3) - Leave coalition with conviction
4. **Rebuilding independently** (Rounds 4-6)

**Key Dramatic Moments:**

**The Break (Round 3):**
> "Bruno, we're done. You just passed a policy that specifically targets my faction. I'm leaving the coalition."

*Deliver this with genuine frustration. You believed in the coalition, and they betrayed your principles.*

**The Challenge (Round 2):**
> "I never agreed to that deal. Bruno made it without asking me."

*This plants the seed of conflict that blooms in Round 3*

**Key Relationships:**
- **Bruno:** Starts as ally, becomes antagonist, eventual grudging respect
- **Clara:** Mixed - economic ally, but Inequality conflict
- **Diego:** Ideological opponent you might need
- **Elena:** Fellow outsider after you leave coalition

**Your Principles:**
- Equality > Economic efficiency
- Freedom > Security
- Honesty > Political convenience

**Remember:**
You LEAVE the coalition - that's a major moment. Own it. You're not betraying anyone; they betrayed your values first.

*Good luck, Progressive! Your principles cost you, but they define you.*
