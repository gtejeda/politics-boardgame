# Politics Board Game - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the recommended development sequence based on the design charter.

---

## Current Status: Foundation Phase

---

## Phase 1: Core Model (Current)

> Charter Ref: Principle 12 - "Start with a Minimal Political Model"

### Objectives
- [ ] Finalize core resources (see `design/core-systems/resources.md`)
- [ ] Finalize core institutions (see `design/core-systems/institutions.md`)
- [ ] Finalize core feedback loops (see `design/core-systems/feedback-loops.md`)
- [ ] Define basic turn structure (see `design/mechanics/turn-structure.md`)
- [ ] Define victory/loss conditions (see `design/mechanics/victory-conditions.md`)

### Deliverables
- Playable paper prototype with minimal content
- Core loop validated (does the basic system work?)

### Key Questions to Answer
1. Are the resources meaningful and distinct?
2. Do institutions create interesting constraints?
3. Do feedback loops create dynamic gameplay?
4. Is the turn structure engaging?

---

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable Content

### Objectives
- [ ] Create 10-15 policy cards per category
- [ ] Create 20-30 event cards
- [ ] Design 1 base scenario
- [ ] Create player aids and reference sheets

### Deliverables
- Complete playable game (minimal but full experience)
- First internal playtest sessions

### Key Questions to Answer
1. Does a full game feel complete?
2. Are there enough meaningful decisions?
3. Is the length appropriate?

---

## Phase 3: Balance & Bias Testing

> Charter Ref: Principle 13 - "Playtest for Bias, Not Just Balance"

### Objectives
- [ ] Conduct 10+ playtest sessions
- [ ] Complete bias audits (see `playtesting/bias-audit-template.md`)
- [ ] Identify and fix dominant strategies
- [ ] Verify all victory paths are viable
- [ ] Verify ideological neutrality

### Deliverables
- Completed playtest reports
- Bias audit documentation
- Balance adjustment log

### Key Questions to Answer
1. Does any ideology feel advantaged?
2. Are there obvious dominant strategies?
3. Do consequences feel believable?

---

## Phase 4: Content Expansion

### Objectives
- [ ] Expand policy cards to full set
- [ ] Expand event cards to full set
- [ ] Add 2-3 scenario variants
- [ ] Add advanced rules (optional)

### Deliverables
- Full content set
- Multiple replay scenarios
- Advanced variant rules

### Key Questions to Answer
1. Is there enough variety for replay value?
2. Do scenarios feel distinct?
3. Are advanced rules worth the complexity?

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Production

### Objectives
- [ ] Final rules writing
- [ ] Component design
- [ ] Art direction
- [ ] Manufacturing specifications

### Deliverables
- Production-ready game
- Rulebook
- Component specifications

---

## Phase 6: Expansion Framework

> Charter Ref: Principle 14 - "Design for Expansion Without Rewrites"

### Objectives
- [ ] Document expansion guidelines
- [ ] Create expansion templates
- [ ] Design first expansion concept

### Expansion Types to Consider
- New countries/regions
- Historical eras
- Additional institutions
- Advanced mechanics
- Campaign/legacy mode

---

## Open Design Questions

These questions should be resolved during development:

### Fundamental
- [ ] How many players? (2? 3-4? 5+?)
- [ ] Competitive, cooperative, or semi-cooperative?
- [ ] Real-time elements or purely turn-based?
- [ ] Physical components (board, cards, tokens)?

### Mechanical
- [ ] How do players interact with institutions?
- [ ] How is public opinion modeled?
- [ ] How do coalitions/negotiations work?
- [ ] How visible is game state to players?

### Content
- [ ] What is the base game scenario?
- [ ] How "real-world" vs. abstract should it be?
- [ ] What time scale does a game represent?
