# Turn Structure

> This document outlines the proposed turn/round structure. All elements are provisional pending playtesting.

---

## Design Goals for Turn Structure

1. **Institutional realism:** Actions flow through proper channels
2. **Meaningful choices:** Each phase offers real decisions
3. **Player interaction:** Opportunities for negotiation/conflict
4. **Pacing:** Balance between action and consequence resolution

---

## Proposed Round Structure

### Phase 1: Event/Situation
**Purpose:** Introduce external pressures and new information

- Draw event card(s)
- Reveal delayed effects from previous rounds
- Update public information

**Player agency:** React, not act

---

### Phase 2: Deliberation
**Purpose:** Planning and negotiation

- Players discuss, negotiate, form coalitions
- Review available actions and costs
- No binding commitments (cheap talk allowed)

**Player agency:** Full communication, no mechanics

---

### Phase 3: Policy Action
**Purpose:** Core gameplay decisions

- Players select and play policy cards
- Legislative voting/resolution
- Resource expenditure

**Player agency:** Primary decision phase

---

### Phase 4: Implementation
**Purpose:** Resolve what actually happens

- Executive implementation (may modify outcomes)
- Judicial review (may block/modify)
- Immediate effects resolve

**Player agency:** Limited - mostly resolution

---

### Phase 5: Consequences
**Purpose:** System feedback

- Resource adjustments
- Delayed effect timers advance
- Feedback loops trigger
- Victory/loss condition checks

**Player agency:** Observation, learning

---

### Phase 6: Cycle
**Purpose:** Prepare for next round

- Draw new cards
- Refresh exhausted resources/abilities
- Advance round marker

---

## Alternative Structures to Consider

### Simultaneous Action Selection
All players secretly choose actions, then reveal together.
- Pro: Faster, reduces analysis paralysis
- Con: Less negotiation, harder to model legislative process

### Initiative-Based
Turn order determined by a resource or bidding.
- Pro: Another strategic lever
- Con: May advantage certain strategies

### Asymmetric Phases
Different player types have different phase structures.
- Pro: Models different political actors
- Con: Complexity, balance difficulty

## Timing Mechanisms for Delayed Effects

### Timer Tokens
Effects have countdown tokens; remove one per round until triggered.

### Queue System
Effects enter a queue and resolve in order when they reach the front.

### Threshold Triggers
Effects remain dormant until a resource/condition crosses a threshold.

## Open Questions

- [ ] How long should a game be? (rounds, real-time)
- [ ] Should there be distinct "eras" within a game?
- [ ] How do we handle player elimination vs. continued play?
- [ ] What's the right number of decisions per round?
