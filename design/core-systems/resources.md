> Charter Ref: Principle 12 - "Before adding content, define core resources"

This document defines the fundamental resources players manage. All policies, events, and mechanics interact through these.

## Design Criteria for Resources

Each resource must:
- Be clearly measurable (numeric or tracked state)
- Create meaningful tradeoffs with at least one other resource
- Connect to multiple policy areas
- Support different victory paths

## Resource Interaction Matrix

| | Budget | Legitimacy | Stability | Growth | Liberty |
|---|--------|------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Budget** | - | Can buy legitimacy (limited) | Funds stability | Invests in growth | - |
| **Legitimacy** | Enables taxation | - | Enables reform | Investor confidence | Rights credibility |
| **Stability** | Reduces crisis costs | Foundation for trust | - | Business environment | Can suppress |
| **Growth** | Tax revenue | Rising expectations | Jobs, opportunity | - | Economic freedom |
| **Liberty** | - | Democratic legitimacy | Can destabilize | Innovation | - |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should "Influence" (international) be a 6th resource or a derived metric?
- [ ] How granular should resource tracking be? (1-10 scale? 1-100?)
- [ ] Should resources have "crisis thresholds" that trigger events?
