# Core Feedback Loops

> Charter Ref: Principle 12 - "Before adding content, define core feedback loops"
> Charter Ref: Principle 5 - "Consequences are often delayed"

Feedback loops are the dynamic systems that create emergent gameplay. They ensure that actions have ripple effects and that the game state evolves meaningfully.

---

## Types of Feedback Loops

### Reinforcing Loops (Positive Feedback)
Amplify changes - success breeds success, failure breeds failure. Create momentum but risk runaway states.

### Balancing Loops (Negative Feedback)
Counteract changes - success creates resistance, failure triggers correction. Create stability but risk stagnation.

## Core Feedback Loops

### 1. Economic Cycle
**Type:** Reinforcing (both directions)

```
Growth ──► Tax Revenue ──► Investment ──► Growth
   │                                         │
   └──── OR ────────────────────────────────┘

Recession ──► Budget Crisis ──► Cuts ──► Recession
```

**Charter compliance:** Creates tradeoff pressure (Principle 2), delayed effects as cycles build (Principle 5)

---

### 2. Legitimacy Spiral
**Type:** Reinforcing (both directions)

```
High Legitimacy ──► Policy Acceptance ──► Successful Implementation ──► Higher Legitimacy

Low Legitimacy ──► Resistance ──► Policy Failure ──► Lower Legitimacy
```

**Charter compliance:** Systems over individuals (Principle 3), failure is instructive (Principle 11)

---

### 3. Stability-Liberty Tension
**Type:** Balancing

```
Instability ──► Security Measures ──► Liberty Reduction ──► Resentment ──► Instability
      │                                                                        │
      └───────────────────── Balancing pressure ──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Charter compliance:** Mandatory tradeoffs (Principle 2), no utopias (Principle 8)

---

### 4. Inequality Accumulation
**Type:** Reinforcing with delayed balancing

```
Growth Policies ──► Wealth Accumulation ──► Political Influence ──► More Growth Policies
                           │
                           ▼ (Delayed)
                    Inequality Rise ──► Social Instability ──► Legitimacy Pressure
```

**Charter compliance:** Delayed consequences (Principle 5), tradeoffs (Principle 2)

---

### 5. Institutional Erosion/Strengthening
**Type:** Slow reinforcing

```
Institutional Bypass ──► Weakened Norms ──► Easier Future Bypass ──► Institutional Collapse

Institutional Respect ──► Strengthened Norms ──► Harder to Bypass ──► Institutional Resilience
```

**Charter compliance:** Systems over individuals (Principle 3), delayed effects (Principle 5)

---

### 6. Reform Backlash
**Type:** Balancing

```
Rapid Reform ──► Disruption ──► Backlash ──► Reform Reversal/Slowdown
                                    │
                                    ▼
                            New Equilibrium
```

**Charter compliance:** No utopias (Principle 8), tradeoffs (Principle 2)

---

### 7. Crisis Response
**Type:** Balancing with risk

```
Crisis ──► Emergency Action ──► Short-term Stability
                │
                ▼
        Legitimacy Cost (if overreach)
        Budget Cost (always)
        Liberty Cost (often)
```

**Charter compliance:** Tradeoffs (Principle 2), multiple paths (Principle 10)

---

## Timing Considerations

| Loop | Speed | Rounds to Manifest |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Crisis Response | Immediate | 0-1 |
| Economic Cycle | Medium | 2-4 |
| Legitimacy Spiral | Medium | 1-3 |
| Stability-Liberty | Slow | 3-5 |
| Inequality | Very Slow | 4-8 |
| Institutional Change | Very Slow | 5-10 |

## Preventing Runaway States

To avoid games being "decided" too early by feedback loops:

1. **Circuit Breakers:** Automatic stabilizers when metrics hit extremes
2. **Intervention Events:** Crisis cards that reset or shift dynamics
3. **Adaptive Costs:** Actions become more expensive as advantage grows
4. **Coalition Incentives:** Mechanics that encourage balancing coalitions

## Open Questions

- [ ] How visible should feedback loops be to players? (Explicit vs. discovered)
- [ ] Should there be a "loop diagram" on the player board?
- [ ] How do we test for runaway/dominant strategies?
