## Policy Balance Check

| Category | Left-Lean | Center | Right-Lean | Authoritarian |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Economic | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 |
| Social | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Security | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 |
| Institutional | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| Foreign | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| **Total** | **6** | **3** | **8** | **1** |

[DISCUSS] Current sample set leans slightly right in quantity. Full deck should balance. Security policies inherently lean right due to subject matter - need left-coded security alternatives.

## Design Principles Demonstrated

1. **Every policy has a tradeoff** - No pure wins
2. **Delayed effects create anticipation** - Players must plan ahead
3. **Institutional paths matter** - Some policies harder to pass
4. **Ideology is descriptive, not prescriptive** - Any faction can play any policy
5. **Resource interactions cascade** - Liberty loss affects Legitimacy, etc.
