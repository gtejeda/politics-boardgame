# Design Decisions - The Political Path

This document addresses the open design questions from the rules and provides recommendations with rationale.

## Open Questions Answered

### 1. Board Shape: Linear Path (Recommended)

**Decision:** Linear path representing one government term (4 years)

**Rationale:**
- **Clear goal:** A finish line creates natural urgency and race tension
- **Thematic coherence:** Government terms have defined beginnings and ends
- **Simpler teaching:** No confusion about laps or position interpretation
- **Natural escalation:** Zones progress from hopeful → challenging → crisis → legacy
- **Defined end state:** Game concludes cleanly with a winner

**Alternative considered:** Circular path (multiple terms)
- Would require more complex victory conditions
- Dilutes the "race to become president" theme
- Harder for new players to understand position

---

### 2. Dice Type: 2d6 Bell Curve (Recommended)

**Decision:** Two standard d6 dice (sum of both)

**Rationale:**
- **Predictable strategy:** Average roll of 7 allows planning
- **Reduced randomness:** Bell curve means extreme results are rare
- **Familiar mechanic:** Most players know 2d6 from other games
- **Special roll effects:** 2 (crisis) and 12 (mandate) create memorable moments
- **Cost effective:** Standard dice, no custom production needed

**Alternative considered:** Custom die with political symbols
- Higher production cost
- Harder to replace if lost
- Novel but unnecessary complexity

**Movement calibration:**
- 40 spaces with average roll 7 = ~6 turns minimum
- With modifiers: ~8-12 turns typical game
- Target playtime: 45-60 minutes achieved

---

### 3. Deal Tracking: Physical Tokens (Recommended)

**Decision:** Physical Support Tokens given between players

**Rationale:**
- **Visual accountability:** Everyone sees who owes whom
- **Social pressure:** Breaking a visible promise feels consequential
- **Memory aid:** Eliminates "did you promise?" disputes
- **Strategic depth:** Token management becomes its own resource
- **Tactile engagement:** Handing over tokens is satisfying

**Rules:**
- 3 tokens per player in their ideology color
- Give token = binding promise to vote YES on recipient's next proposal
- Token returns to original owner after deal is honored
- Breaking deal: recipient keeps token + gains Influence

**Alternative considered:** Written contracts
- Slows down negotiation phase
- Feels overly formal for a party game
- Creates admin overhead

**Alternative considered:** Pure social pressure (no tracking)
- Leads to "he said, she said" disputes
- Some players forget promises
- Less strategic depth

### 4. Movement Values: ✓ +1 to +3 / ✗ -1 to -2 (Recommended)

**Decision:** Aligned ideologies gain +1 to +3 spaces; opposed lose -1 to -2

**Rationale:**
- **Positive-sum feel:** Gains outweigh losses on average
- **Coalition incentive:** +2/+3 bonuses are worth negotiating for
- **Catchup mechanic:** Players behind benefit from others' decisions
- **Zone escalation:** Crisis zone has bigger swings (+4/-2) for drama
- **Balanced math:** Average net movement per card is slightly positive

**Zone-specific ranges:**
| Zone | ✓ Advance | ✗ Retreat |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Early Term | +1 to +2 | -1 |
| Mid-Term | +2 to +3 | -1 to -2 |
| Crisis | +2 to +4 | -1 to -2 |
| Late Term | +1 to +3 | -1 |

**Alternative considered:** +1/-1 flat
- Less dramatic, fewer memorable moments
- Reduced incentive to negotiate

**Alternative considered:** +3/-3 symmetric
- Too punishing for opposed players
- Creates feel-bad moments
- Discourages participation

---

### 5. Path Length: 40 Spaces (Recommended)

**Decision:** 40 spaces divided into 5 zones of 8 each

**Rationale:**
- **Math checks out:** 40 ÷ 7 (avg roll) = ~6 turns minimum
- **Zone pacing:** 8 spaces per zone means 1-2 turns per zone
- **Game length:** With negotiation, delays, modifiers: 45-60 minutes
- **Milestone moments:** Special spaces at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35
- **Catchup window:** Enough spaces for trailing players to recover

**Zone breakdown:**
| Zone | Spaces | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Early Term | 1-8 | Setup, easy decisions |
| Mid-Term | 9-18 | Core gameplay |
| Crisis | 19-28 | Maximum drama |
| Late Term | 29-36 | Positioning, legacy |
| End of Government | 37-40 | Victory approach |

**Alternative considered:** 30 spaces
- Too short, not enough time for deals to matter
- Players rush past crisis zone

**Alternative considered:** 60 spaces
- Too long, game drags
- Player attention wanes

## Additional Design Decisions

### Timer for Deliberation: 3 Minutes

**Decision:** Sand timer or phone timer for deliberation phase

**Rationale:**
- Prevents analysis paralysis
- Maintains game pace
- Creates urgency that mirrors real politics
- Encourages decisive negotiation

**Flexibility:** Can be removed for learning games or extended for complex situations.

---

### Player Count: 3-5 (Optimal: 4)

**Decision:** Support 3-5 players, design for 4

**Rationale:**
- **3 players:** Majority = 2 votes, coalitions are tight
- **4 players:** Ideal balance, 3-vote majority, dynamic alliances
- **5 players:** Rich negotiation, 3-vote majority, longer turns

**Scaling adjustments:**
| Players | Majority Needed | Starting Influence |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 3 | 2 votes | 5 each |
| 4 | 3 votes | 5 each |
| 5 | 3 votes | 5 each |

---

### Influence Cap: 9 Maximum

**Decision:** Influence track runs 0-9

**Rationale:**
- Prevents runaway leaders
- Forces spending decisions
- Creates tension at high influence (do I spend or save?)
- 4-point veto remains expensive even at max influence

---

### Starting Values

| Resource | Starting Value | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Nation Stability | 10 | Room to grow (+5) or fall (-10 to collapse) |
| Nation Budget | 8 | Slightly constrained, encourages fiscal trade-offs |
| Player Influence | 5 | Middle of track, room to grow or shrink |
| Support Tokens | 3 per player | Enough for sustained deals, not unlimited |

---

### Collapse Thresholds

| Collapse Trigger | Threshold | Design Intent |
|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| Stability | ≤ 0 | Represents civil unrest, institutional breakdown |
| Budget | ≤ -5 | Represents sovereign debt crisis, default |

**Why asymmetric:**
- Stability collapse at 0: Immediate existential threat
- Budget can go negative: Deficit spending is real, but has limits
- -5 Budget gives more warning than sudden 0

---

### Victory Influence Requirement: ≥3

**Decision:** Must have at least 3 Influence to cross the finish line

**Rationale:**
- Prevents hollow victories (racing ahead while politically irrelevant)
- Creates end-game tension (do I spend or save for finish?)
- Encourages balanced play, not just speed
- Spaces 37-39 serve as "waiting room" for low-influence leaders

---

## Component Quality Recommendations

### Production Tiers

**Print-and-Play (Budget):**
- Cardstock cards (home printed)
- Paper money for tokens
- Dice from any game
- Printed board

**Standard Edition:**
- 300gsm linen-finish cards
- Wooden pawns
- Custom wooden tokens
- Folding game board
- Plastic-coated dice

**Deluxe Edition:**
- Premium box with insert
- Metal coins for tokens
- Resin pawns
- Mounted game board
- Custom engraved dice

---

## Playtesting Priorities

### Must Test
1. **Movement balance:** Is 40 spaces right? Do games end in 45-60 min?
2. **Card balance:** Does every ideology win roughly equally over many games?
3. **Support Token economy:** Are 3 tokens enough? Too many?
4. **Catchup mechanic:** Can trailing players win, or is first-place advantage too strong?
5. **Collapse frequency:** Do games end in collapse appropriately (maybe 15-20% of games)?

### Key Metrics to Track
- Average game length
- Win rate by ideology
- Win rate by starting position
- Collapse rate (Stability vs. Budget)
- Cards that consistently have "obvious" choices (need rebalancing)
- Player engagement during others' turns
