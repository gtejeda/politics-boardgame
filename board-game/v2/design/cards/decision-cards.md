## Card Balance Summary

### Ideology Benefit Distribution

Each ideology should benefit from roughly equal number of card options across the full deck:

| Ideology | Primary Benefit (✓+2 or more) | Secondary Benefit (✓+1) |
|----------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Progressive | 18 cards | 12 cards |
| Conservative | 18 cards | 14 cards |
| Liberal | 17 cards | 15 cards |
| Nationalist | 14 cards | 10 cards |
| Populist | 13 cards | 8 cards |

### Penalty Distribution

| Ideology | Major Penalty (✗-2) | Minor Penalty (✗-1) |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Progressive | 8 cards | 10 cards |
| Conservative | 10 cards | 8 cards |
| Liberal | 10 cards | 10 cards |
| Nationalist | 12 cards | 8 cards |
| Populist | 14 cards | 10 cards |

**Design Note:** Populist intentionally has more penalties because populism often clashes with establishment decisions. This is balanced by Populist frequently appearing as a coalition partner with Progressive.

### Nation Impact Balance

| Zone | Avg Budget Change | Avg Stability Change |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Early Term | -0.5 | +0.5 |
| Mid-Term | -1.0 | +0.3 |
| Crisis | -1.8 | -0.5 |
| Late Term | -0.3 | +0.3 |

Crisis zone deliberately drains resources and stability to create tension.

## Card Writing Guidelines

### Good Card Characteristics

1. **No obvious "right answer"** - Every option should appeal to someone
2. **Coalition potential** - At least two ideologies benefit from each option
3. **Real tradeoffs** - Budget vs. Stability, short-term vs. long-term
4. **Historical grounding** - Based on real political dilemmas
5. **Clear language** - Options understood in 5 seconds

### Example of Poor Card Design (Don't Do This)

```
BAD CARD: "CORRUPTION SCANDAL"

A) INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE
   ✓ Everyone +2
   ✗ (none)

B) COVER IT UP
   ✗ Everyone -2

Problem: Obviously A is correct. No negotiation needed.
```

### Example of Good Card Design (Do This)

```
GOOD CARD: "CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION"

A) INDEPENDENT INQUIRY
   Budget -1, Stability -1
   ✓ Progressive +2, Liberal +2
   ✗ Conservative -1 (institutional exposure)

B) INTERNAL REVIEW
   Stability +1
   ✓ Conservative +2, Nationalist +1
   ✗ Progressive -1, Liberal -1

C) LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT
   Budget -1
   ✓ Liberal +1, Conservative +1
   ✗ Populist -1

All options have costs and beneficiaries. Players must negotiate.
```
