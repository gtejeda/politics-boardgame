## The Game Concept

**Players:** 3-5
**Time:** 60-120 minutes (varies by version)
**Mode:** Semi-cooperative with individual victory

Players represent faction leaders within a single nation. The nation must survive (collective goal), but only one player wins based on their legacy achievements (individual goal).

### Core Tension

Every policy has tradeoffs. Players must negotiate, form coalitions, and make difficult choices knowing that helping the nation might not help their personal victory—and vice versa.

## Development Process

1. **Design** - Create rules and content in `versions/vX/`
2. **Playtest** - Run sessions, record in `playtesting/sessions/`
3. **Iterate** - Archive current version, start new version with lessons learned
