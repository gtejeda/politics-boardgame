# Next Steps Checklist

This checklist guides concrete discussions to advance the game from design framework to playable prototype.

> **Start here:** See `COLLABORATION-WORKFLOW.md` for meeting guides and facilitation tips.
> **Full schedule:** See `SESSION-SCHEDULE.md` for the complete 12-session plan.

## Phase 1: Finalize Core Model (Current Phase)

### 1.1 Fundamental Game Structure
- [ ] **Player count decision** - How many players? (2-player duel, 3-4 optimal, 5+ party game?)
- [ ] **Game mode decision** - Competitive, cooperative, or semi-cooperative?
- [ ] **Game length target** - 30min, 60min, 90min, 2hr+?
- [ ] **Abstraction level** - Fictional setting vs. real-world inspired vs. historical?

### 1.2 Player Roles & Agency
- [ ] **What do players represent?** - Political parties? Ideologies? Interest groups? Government branches?
- [ ] **How do players interact with institutions?** - Direct control? Influence tokens? Voting?
- [ ] **Coalition mechanics** - How do players negotiate and form alliances?
- [ ] **Asymmetric vs. symmetric** - Same starting position or unique factions?

### 1.3 Core Resource Refinement
- [ ] **Resource scale** - Numeric ranges for Budget, Legitimacy, Stability, Growth, Liberty
- [ ] **Starting values** - Default resource levels at game start
- [ ] **Threshold effects** - What happens at low/high resource levels?
- [ ] **Resource interaction rates** - How much do tradeoffs cost? (e.g., +1 Growth = -1 Liberty?)

### 1.4 Institution Mechanics
- [ ] **Legislature** - Voting mechanics, majority thresholds, coalition requirements
- [ ] **Judiciary** - Constitutional review trigger conditions, veto power limits
- [ ] **Executive** - Implementation success/failure mechanics
- [ ] **Markets** - Economic dice/cards? Predictable vs. random?
- [ ] **Public Opinion** - Polling track? Approval ratings? Election cycle?
- [ ] **Civil Society** - Protest mechanics? Interest group influence?

### 1.5 Turn Structure Details
- [ ] **Event draw rules** - How many? Player choice or random?
- [ ] **Deliberation time limits** - Timed or open negotiation?
- [ ] **Policy action limits** - How many policies per turn per player?
- [ ] **Voting procedure** - Simultaneous? Sequential? Secret?
- [ ] **Implementation resolution** - Automatic or contested?
- [ ] **Feedback loop triggers** - Which loops activate each turn?

### 1.6 Victory & Endgame
- [ ] **Game end trigger** - Fixed rounds? Crisis threshold? Player-triggered?
- [ ] **Scoring system details** - Points per dimension, weights, tiebreakers
- [ ] **Legacy track options** - Which dimensions available? Player-chosen or assigned?
- [ ] **Loss condition specifics** - Exact thresholds for each collapse type

## Phase 2: First Content Creation

### 2.1 Policy Card Development
- [ ] **Card template finalization** - Final layout with all required fields
- [ ] **Economic policies (10-15)** - Tax, spending, regulation, trade cards
- [ ] **Social policies (10-15)** - Welfare, education, healthcare cards
- [ ] **Security policies (10-15)** - Military, police, intelligence cards
- [ ] **Institutional policies (10-15)** - Reform, amendment, process cards
- [ ] **Foreign policies (10-15)** - Diplomacy, alliance, sanction cards
- [ ] **Ideological balance audit** - Count left/right/center lean distribution

### 2.2 Event Card Development
- [ ] **Event template finalization** - Layout with severity, choices, effects
- [ ] **Economic events (10-15)** - Market crashes, booms, trade disruptions
- [ ] **Social events (10-15)** - Movements, demographic shifts, health crises
- [ ] **Political events (10-15)** - Scandals, elections, coalition breaks
- [ ] **International events (10-15)** - Wars, treaties, global pressures
- [ ] **Natural events (5-10)** - Disasters, resource discoveries
- [ ] **Severity distribution check** - 40% minor / 35% moderate / 20% major / 5% crisis

### 2.3 Base Scenario
- [ ] **Scenario selection** - Which of the 4 candidates? (Republic, Transition, Federation, Crisis)
- [ ] **Starting conditions document** - All resource levels, institution states
- [ ] **Available card subset** - Which policies/events included
- [ ] **Special rules (if any)** - Scenario-specific mechanics
- [ ] **Historical context notes** - Post-game discussion points

---

## Phase 3: Paper Prototype

### 3.1 Component Creation
- [ ] **Resource tracking method** - Tokens, tracks, dials, or cards?
- [ ] **Policy card printouts** - Basic design for testing
- [ ] **Event card printouts** - Basic design for testing
- [ ] **Institution board/cards** - Visual representation of each institution
- [ ] **Player aids** - Turn summary, resource effects, victory conditions
- [ ] **Tracking sheets** - For delayed effects, feedback loops

### 3.2 Rules Document
- [ ] **Quick-start rules (1 page)** - Core loop only
- [ ] **Full rules draft** - Complete turn sequence, all mechanics
- [ ] **Edge case rulings** - Anticipated questions and answers
- [ ] **Example turn walkthrough** - Illustrated gameplay example

### 3.3 First Playtest
- [ ] **Solo playtest** - Play all positions yourself
- [ ] **Identify broken mechanics** - What doesn't work at all?
- [ ] **Identify unfun mechanics** - What works but feels bad?
- [ ] **Timing check** - How long does a full game take?
- [ ] **Decision quality check** - Are choices meaningful?
- [ ] **Complete playtest template** - Document findings formally

## Open Questions for Discussion

Priority discussions to unlock design progress:

### High Priority (Blocking Progress)
1. What do players physically represent in the game world?
2. How do multiple players share control over a single government?
3. What's the core "fun loop" - the moment-to-moment enjoyment?
4. How abstract vs. concrete should policies be? ("Increase Taxes" vs. "Progressive Income Tax Reform")

### Medium Priority (Affects Content Design)
5. Should there be hidden information? (Secret goals, hidden votes, unknown events)
6. How much randomness? (Dice, shuffled decks, market volatility)
7. Real-time pressure or unlimited deliberation?
8. How do delayed effects get tracked and revealed?

### Lower Priority (Can Iterate Later)
9. Physical component quality (prototype vs. production)
10. Art style and theme presentation
11. Expansion content hooks
12. Digital companion app potential

## Charter Compliance Checks

Before each major milestone, verify:

- [ ] **Principle 1** - No ideology has mechanical advantage
- [ ] **Principle 2** - Every policy has meaningful tradeoffs
- [ ] **Principle 7** - Players can mix ideological strategies
- [ ] **Principle 10** - Multiple victory paths tested and viable
- [ ] **Principle 11** - Losses are traceable to decisions
