## Art Direction Notes

*(To be developed)*

### Visual Principles
- Neutral color coding (avoid red=bad, green=good)
- Abstract over realistic (reduce real-world associations)
- Clear iconography over text where possible
- Accessible design (colorblind-friendly, readable fonts)

### Style Considerations
- Modernist/clean vs. textured/illustrated
- Color palette definition
- Iconography system
- Typography selection
